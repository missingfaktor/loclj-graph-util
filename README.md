# loclj-graph-util

This a simple Clojure port of graph-util from Chapter 7 of the book Land of Lisp. You can see the original
Common Lisp code [here](http://landoflisp.com/graph-util.lisp). 

In addition, I have also implemented a graph "imagifier" (can someone please suggest a better word?) on top
of JUNG 2.0.1, which gives worse results, but unlike Graphviz graph imagifier, is a pure Java\* solution.

<sub>\* Java as in Java environment, not the Java langauge.</sub>
